    \textbf{\Large Abstract}
\end{center}
Since stock prices are time series data, most academic studies have focused on time series forecasting in machine learning models. Unfortunately, these models do not perform as well as they need to. In this project, we will be designing a novel model that predicts Stock Price and Direction with the help of Deep Attention-based Convolutional Neural Networks based on image processing properties using 2-D images after converting the 1-D time-series signal images to 2-D images with the help of the technical indicator. We will be testing the model we have built and compare its performance to state-of-the-art models at the end of this project. If the results are as expected, we aim to put the model to the test on a major crypto exchange platform such as Binance. We'll start by gathering price and technical indicator data for a variety of cryptocurrencies. Then, utilizing this information, we'll construct a two-dimensional image with the stock price as one dimension and technical indicators as the other. We will obtain our model by training deep attention-based convolutional neural networks with these images. The implementation part of the project will be done in Python Programming Language.

    \section{Related Work}
\end{center}
In many academic studies, machine learning models were used when stock prediction was made because stock prices are time series data. Nevertheless, the machine learning models used for stock-price prediction were not performing excellently. Thus, better-performing models were required for stock prices.\vspace{0.2cm} \\*
In recent years, forecast models based on deep learning have emerged as the best performers in financial forecasts. Moreover, many academic and sectoral studies have been conducted using different deep-learning models. The article named "Attention Augmented Convolutional Networks" [1] implemented by the Google Brain team under the umbrella of Google AI, the article named "Algorithmic Financial Trading with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks: Time Series to Image Conversion Approach" [2], the article named "Patches Are All You Need?" [3] or the article named "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale" [4] can be given examples of these studies. Our approach in the senior project is analogous to the "Algorithmic Financial Trading with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks: Time Series to Image Conversion Approach" article, but while using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in this article, we use the ConvMixer architecture, introduced in 2021, which is thought to perform better according to research's.\vspace{0.2cm} \\*
Although CNNs have dominated computer vision tasks for many years, recent research has shown that Transformer-based models, most notably the Vision Transformer (ViT), can outperform CNN in some cases.[3] ConvMixer an extremely straightforward model that is similar to the ViT; hence, we are using this architecture in our senior project.

\begin{center}
    \section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\end{center}
In this section, we provide a brief summary of the senior project and we talk about the future work of the project.\\*
\subsection{Conclusion}
To summarize our senior project, we use the ConvMixer model that predicts Stock Price and Direction with the help of Deep Attention Based Convolutional Neural Networks after transforming 1D time-series signal images into 2D time-series signals with the help of technical indicators. We think that the last version of senior project will have a consequential economic impact. Companies or investors can buy their stocks in a more optimized way with the last version of our senior project, and as a result, investors can use the money that normally is melt away by their manual trading techniques on different opportunities. Furthermore, We think that our project will have an optimistic social impact because we believe that investors can be mirthful with the right investments they make. Also, After some thought about what ethical issues we might encounter in our senior project, we realized that there might be a problem. If the model we will apply constructs an inaccurate prediction, we can mislead the investors \& companies and make an erroneous investment decision.
\subsection{Future Work}
• Finding the best hyperparameters of our model using sites like Weights \& Biases. [5]\\*
• Utilizing the Cross-Validation to make the performance of the model more accurate.\\*
• On a high-dimensional scale, the assessment measures and their correlation may be examined.\\*
• Running models on different Datasets \& Technical Indicators and reporting the results.\\*
• Testing the model on a major crypto exchange platform like Binance after doing the work above.\\*
• Finally, implementing a new project that makes an automatic trading bot for cryptocurrencies using this model.
